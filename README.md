GPT-2 Text Generator

This project fine-tunes GPT-2, a transformer-based language model, on a custom dataset to generate human-like text.

📌 Features

Fine-tunes GPT-2 on any text dataset (train.txt).

Generates new text in the style of your dataset.

Easy to run and extend.

🛠️ Requirements

Install dependencies using:

pip install -r requirements.txt


Dependencies:

transformers

datasets

torch

🚀 Usage
1. Prepare Dataset

Add your training data in train.txt. Example:

The sun sets over the hills with golden light.
Generative AI can create text, music, and even images.

2. Train the Model

Run the fine-tuning script:

python gpt2_finetune.py

3. Generate Text

After training, test your model:

python generate.py
